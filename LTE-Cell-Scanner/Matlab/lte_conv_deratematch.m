function d_est=lte_conv_deratematch(e_est,n_c)

% d_est=lte_conv_deratematch(e_est,n_c);
%
% Undoes the rate-matching operation which mapped the 'd_est' bits to the
% 'e_est' bits.
%
% n_c is the number of bits that were originally input to the convolutional
% encoder.
%
% e_est(k) is the probability that a '1' was transmitted in bit position k.
