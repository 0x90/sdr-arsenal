TODO:

1. SIB decoding when hackrf is present because hackrf seems has enough BW. (rtl-sdr's BW is not enough for decoding SIB)
2. OpenCL acceleration/optimization of MIB and SIB decoding.
3. k_factor should be updated in a correct way when carrier-sampling isn't twistted. See k_factor in src/producer_thread.cpp
4. AGC
